# Real Estate Calc
<h3>House calculator that was built to see if a house was a good investment</h3>
<br>
<p> If you want to use: simply add on or subtract from the rent dictionaries at the top of house.py

format as such: 

    {'< Location as a string >':[< zip code >, [< lowest you'll take for rent >, < highest you'll take for rent >]]}

Your cashflow is ran with the lowest rent so you don't over estimate your cashflow and get yourself into a bad investment.
